*** [ Peer Learning Day ] ***


*- Peer Learning Day
Peer learning days (PLD) are mandatory days.
You must collaborate with your assigned group.
Peer Learning Days are not about sharing solutions.
That does not empower peers with the ability to solve problems themselves!
Peer Learning is when you share your thought process - whether through conversation, whiteboarding, debugging or live coding.
Examples:
    “How did you come to that conclusion?”
    “What had you tried?”
    “Did the man page give you a lead?”
    “Did you remember a fundamental concept that shed light on your challenge”
