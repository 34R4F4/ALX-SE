*Problem Solving

- Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Problem
  [Input]--->(Process)--->[Output]

- Step 2: Go Through The Sample Data And Examples Thoroughly
tray many inputs  and analyze the output
breake down big problem to subproblems

- Step 4: Write Pseudocode, make a flowchart
Make a flow chart for the problem at hand.

- Step 5: Replace Pseudocode With Real Code
While writing the code keep in mind three things:
  -The point where you started.
  -Where are you right now? 
  -What is your destination (end result)?

- Step 6: Simplify and Optimize your Code
    Does this code run for every possible input including the edge cases.
    Is there an alternate solution for the same problem?
    Is the code efficient? Can it be more efficient or can the performance be improved?
    How else can you make the code more readable?
    Are there any more extra steps or functions you can take out?
    Is there any repetition in your code? Take it out.
