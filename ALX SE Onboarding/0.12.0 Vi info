**What is vi?**

Vi is a text editor that is used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is a modal editor, which means that it has two different modes: command mode and insert mode. In command mode, you can give vi commands to edit the text. In insert mode, you can type text directly into the file.

Bill Joy is an American computer scientist who is best known for co-developing the vi text editor and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). He is also a co-founder of Sun Microsystems.

**How to start and exit vi**

To start vi, you can type `vi <filename>` in a terminal window. This will open the file `<filename>` in vi. To exit vi, you can type `:wq` or `ZZ`. The `:wq` command saves the file and quits vi. The `ZZ` command also saves the file, but it is a shortcut for `:w` and `:q`.

**What are the command and insert modes, and how to switch from one to the other**

The command mode is the default mode in vi. In command mode, you can give vi commands to edit the text. To enter insert mode, you can type the `i` key. In insert mode, you can type text directly into the file. To switch back to command mode, you can type the `Esc` key.
