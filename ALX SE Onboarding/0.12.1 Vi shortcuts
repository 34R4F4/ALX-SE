    ? – Like /, but searches backwards.
    f – Type an f followed by any character to quickly move the cursor to the next occurrence of the character on the current line.
        For example, if you have the line “Hello world” on a line and your cursor is at the beginning of the line, type fo to move to the o in Hello. Type fo again to move to the o in world.
    F – Like f, but searches backwards.
    % – Jump between the nearest (), [], or {} characters on the line.

Use these commands to quickly move to locations in the file:

    M – Move cursor to middle line in file.
    L – Move cursor to lowest (bottom) line in file.
    #G – Type a number and then type G to go to that line in the file.
        For example, type 4G and press Enter to move to the fourth line in the file.

    w – Move forward a word.
    #w – Move forward a number of words. For example, 2w moves forward two words.

    v – Press v and move the cursor to select a section of text.

# Repeat & Undo 
    u – Undo.
