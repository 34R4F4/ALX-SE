Here is a cheat sheet of some of the most common command line commands:

**Navigation**

* `cd` - Change directory
* `pwd` - Print working directory
* `ls` - List files and directories
* `ls -a` - List all files and directories, including hidden files
* `cd ..` - Go up one directory

* `rmdir` - Remove an empty directory
* `touch` - Create a new file

**Other**

Here are some additional tips for using the command line:

* Use tab completion to auto-complete file and directory names.
* Use the `|` (pipe) character to chain commands together.
* Use the `&&` (and) and `||` (or) operators to combine commands.
* Use the `grep` command to search for text in files.
* Use the `find` command to find files based on their attributes.

I hope this cheat sheet helps you get started with the command line!
